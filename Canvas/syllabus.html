            <p>This course is "flipped" and uses an "active learning" course design.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flipped in this context is where you watch lecture videos outside of class and work on solving problems during class time.
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>During class time you will be in groups, actively working through example problems.</li>
                        <li>This format provides students more time to process and reflect on course material so that class time can be used to ask their specific questions and get immediate help while working through material.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>During class, students will be actively working through problems based on content discussed in lecture videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <ul>
                        <li>These questions often extend the concepts presented in the lecture videos</li>
                        <li>Additional short videos are provided at various points in the activities to help students navigate potentially tricky problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>The instructor will also move around groups to answer questions, clarify concepts, and/or correct misconceptions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This course design can be extremely effective but only if students watch the lectures before class, work through the activities during class, and ask questions right away!</p>

                    <li>We do drop one module exam to account for extenuating circumstances such as illness, family emergencies, religious holidays, school-sponsored events, etc.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Module Exams are open for 24 hours, however, it is strongly encouraged that you take the Module Exam at your scheduled class time. Your instructor will be available during this time to troubleshoot any issues. Keep in mind, that you once you "submit" on the exam, there is nothing the instructor can do to resolve your issue. Be sure to contact your instructor the moment you encounter an issue, before submitting your exam, and before the exam time expires.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If you choose to take the exam outside this window, you may not receive a response in time to resolve the issue. <strong>Any resulting grade or inability to access the exam due to issues encountered while taking the exam outside of class time will not be reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>

            <h4>Interacting Online</h4>
            <p>All students should be aware that their behavior impacts other people, even online. I hope that we will all strive to develop a positive and supportive environment and will be courteous to fellow students and your instructor. Due to the nature of the online environment, there are some things to remember.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Always think before you write. In other words, without the use of nonverbals with your message, your message can be misinterpreted. So please think twice before you hit submit.</li>
                <li>Keep it relevant. There are places to chat and post for fun everyday stuff. Do not stray from the discussion in the assigned questions.</li>
                <li>Never use all caps. This is the equivalent of yelling in the online world. It is not fun to read. Only use capital letters when appropriate.</li>
                <li>Make sure that you are using appropriate grammar and structure. In other words, I don&rsquo;t want to see anyone writing &ldquo;R U&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;are you&rdquo;. There are people in the class that may not understand this type of abbreviation, not to mention it does nothing to help expand your writing and vocabulary skills. Emoticons are fine as long as they are appropriate. A smile ☺is welcome, anything offensive is not.</li>
                <li>Treat people the same as you would face-to-face. In other words, it is easy to hide behind the computer. In some cases, it empowers people to treat others in ways they would not in person. Remember there is a person behind the name on your screen. Treat all with dignity and respect and you can expect that in return.</li>
                <li>Respect the time of others. This class is going to require you to work in groups. Learn to respect the time of others in your group and your experience will be much better. Always remember that you are not the only person with a busy schedule, be flexible. Do not procrastinate! You may be one that works best with the pressures of the deadline looming on you, but others may not be that way. The same is true for the reverse. The key to a successful group is organization, communication and a willingness to do what it takes to get it done.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="">Learning assistants will be joining our class to help facilitate group work and help answer questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning assistants are undergraduate students who have taken this course before.</li>
                <li>They will be moving around groups and asking questions to help you think about key topics during class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>In addition,<span class=""> LAs will report the most commonly asked questions during class each week to the section instructor. From this list, the instructor will go through a detailed solution to those questions (at most 3) during the review session for that exam. If students aren&rsquo;t asking LAs questions, there won&rsquo;t be anything to share!</span>
                </li>
                <li>Also, keep in mind that while LAs are incredible resources, they are not expected to be subject matter experts so there may be times where they will have to reach out to the instructor to help answer questions.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>As with anyone you interact with during class, please be considerate in your interaction with LAs. They are students too!</li>
